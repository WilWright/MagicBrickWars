Magic Brick Wars is where I spent most of my time while at Halfbrick. Shortly after I joined, there was a company-wide initiative to pivot to a cohesive subscription-based platform for all of our games rather than separate free-to-play experiences. As part of this initiative, teams were split up to start building the catalogue of games that would exist on the service, which mostly included polishing up old titles and integrating the Halfbrick+ SDK into them, which allowed users to play with 1 hour of guest time or create an account and access the game with a paid subscription. Magic Brick Wars needed a bit more work than other titles, though. It was initially released in 2019, and then was taken down after Amazon GameSparks shutdown in 2022, which the server was using. Once the strike team I was with was done with our first few titles, we were tasked with replacing the backend and transforming the economy from its free-to-play system, to a more premium one that would fit the subscription service.

For the backend we initially explored [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/PUN), but later went with [Heroic Labs](https://heroiclabs.com/) since the company had previous experience with them. The team at Heroic Labs helped to port over all of the server code while we hooked it up client side, since the team was made up of mostly juniors. We started this work in August 2023, and after several challenge filled months, we made it over the line and released the game on Halfbrick+ in January 2024 to join about 20 other games. Now that our work was done, our current lead at the time went on to form another team to begin creating [Halfbrick Sports: Football](https://www.halfbrick.com/games/halfbrickfootball), since he was initally on loan to help us out. This left a void for the rest of my strike team and some other juniors in other teams after the first Halfbrick+ initiative was complete. Halfbrick was still looking to continue work on Magic Brick Wars to grow with the service, so I stepped up to lead after exemplifying promising leadership skills and high quality output in our previous projects.

Our goals with this new team were to bring back some of the features in the original version (after they were stripped away for scope in the re-release) and connect with the community to help shape the game in its new form as part of a subscription service. Throughout the next 2.5 years my team would go on to implement 7 content updates as we improved our skills and coordination within the company. Once we had the game in a good spot, we moved on to help build out features within Halfbrick+ for the next big initiative.
